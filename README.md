## Crop Vista
This project was built to complete the requirements of "INFO6150 Web Design & User Experience Engineering" course which I took at Northeastern University as part of my Master's degree.

The idea proposes to provide a digital solution, to bring the farmers, MNCs and distributors on the same platform enabling transparency and effective prduction and usage of produced crops. This will also enable farmers in reducing crop wastage by taking informed decisions for crop production which will be in line with the forecasted demand.
